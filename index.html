      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p> <img src="KRudolph7.jpg" alt="Self-portrait of Kimberly Rudolph"> My name is Kimberly. I'm a college student, wife, mother, and lover of all things creative!</p>
      <p>I'm currently a student at Southwestern College where I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Programming Technology. I have just 6 courses remaining and am expected to graduate December 2021! I was led to the computer programming field after spending nearly 10 years working in Technical and Adult Education. During that time I became familiar with various database
        systems and began learning as much as I possible about how they work.</p>
      <p>I've been married for nearly 13 years to my wonderful husband, James. We have two amazing children, 9-year old Aiden and 1-year old Jonah. They are smart, funny, and definitely keep me on my toes. My family and I spend a lot of time together. We enjoy activities, such as traveling, checking out new restaurants, fishing, and going to car shows. When I have spare time of my own (however rare that may be) I have plenty of hobbies to keep myself busy. I am particularly fond of those that allow me to be creative. But I also enjoy getting lost in a good TV series or movie.</p>
